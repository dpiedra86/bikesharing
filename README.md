# Bikesharing

> Overview
This module consists in the data visualization tool Tableau. In data analytics one of the most helpful tools is a visualization tool, which allows us as data manipulators to create different typo of charts and visualizations and help us and others to understand better how our information behaves and what it is happening.
One of the most powerful uses of this tools is as a translator for all the insights into a common visual language that, if accurately presented with the proper storytelling it will drive the conversation the way we would like to flow while helping us demonstrate our findings to others better understand and align with our dicoveries. 

This tools are very popular and easy to connect with various sources of information which makes it incredibly easy to work with. Also it will allow to integrate with coding to make some changes into the tool.
